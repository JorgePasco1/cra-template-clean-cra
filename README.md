# clean-cra

Basic, clean create-react-app template that removes test files, icons, tags inside public html and app jsx, service worker files and unnecesary imports. Also keeps only index.css styles, which now includes original cra background color.

To use this template, run create-react-app as follows: 

```
npx create-react-app <name-of-your-app> --template clean-cra
```

Check out the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cra-template-clean-cra).
